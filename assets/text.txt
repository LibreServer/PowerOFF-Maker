[size=20][color=#FFFFFF]This anti-cheat has been seized as part of Operation AntiFrap.
Operation AntiFrap is an international effort focused on exposing
and shutting down anti-cheat solutions that violate open-source licenses and fail to provide effective protection.
Anti-cheat incompetence is unacceptable. For years, experts have analyzed and exposed weak
detection methods, GPL violations, and misleading claims about cheat prevention.
Our commission has thoroughly reviewed this anti-cheat and concluded that it contains shit quality checks, offering no real security.
Anyone involved in the development or distribution of such
anti-cheat software is subject to scrutiny, legal consequences, and well-deserved public humiliation.[/color][/size]
